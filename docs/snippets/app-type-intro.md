We recommend to not spend time learning about the different app types there is,
but to start writing a prototype instead,
and to worry about this later.

And, instead of reasoning in terms of "app types" we recommend to reason in terms of:
- "Do I want my page to be rendered to HTML and/or the DOM?" (Which we elaborate at !VAR|LINK RENDER_WHEN.)
- "Do I want browser-side routing or server-side routing?" (Which we elaborate at !VAR|LINK CONTROL_ROUTING.)
