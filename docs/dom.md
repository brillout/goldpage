# DOM

To be able to develop a web app,
it is absolutely necessary to have good understanding of what the DOM (Document Object Model) is.

If you don't know any of the following,
we then highly recommend that you learn about the DOM before writing a web app.
- You know that everything you see on a page in a browser is represented by the DOM tree.
- You know that the DOM manipulation APIs are what allows a page to change and to be interactive.
- You are somewhat familiar / you have seen the basic DOM manipulation APIs before: `document.getElementById(id)`, `element.appendChild(aChild)`, `document.createElement(tagName)`, `element.setAttribute(name, value)`, etc.
- You know that view libraries (React/Vue/...) are essentially helper libraries that call the DOM manipulation APIs for you.
- You know that HTML is, essentially, a declarative specification of the initial DOM.
- You know that HTML is generated on the server-side and that the DOM is manipulated on the browser-side.

A high-level explanation of the DOM can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/dom/).

Feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/reframejs/goldpage/issues/new)
or to [chat with us](https://discord.gg/kqXf65G) and we'll teach you and research more DOM resources for you.
