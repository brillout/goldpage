What differentiates Goldpage from he rest is:
- Support for all-app-types
- Simple design
- New app types
- Flexibility

### Only One App Type

The main problem of our current tools is that they support only one app type.
For example for React:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
create-react-app creates a so-called "SPA"
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Next.js creates a so-called "SSR app"
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Gatsby creates a so-called "static website"
<br/>

By choosing one of these tools you are essentially choosing an app type and locking yourself into that app type.
This means that before choosing one of these tools you have to:
- Research about what "SPA", "SSR", and "static website" mean
- Research what the differences between them are.
- Decide
And you have to do all that before even having started writing one line of code.

Even worse is that, most often than not,
it's not possible to predict which app type
is the right one
before having created and battle-tested a first prototype.

Goldpage solves this problem:
it supports all app types and makes switching from one app type to another easy &mdash;
you can start writing a prototype and worry about app type later.

We actually encourage to start with Goldpage's default app type and,
only once you finished your first prototype,
to try out and experiment different app types with your prototye
and see what works best for you.

With Goldpage,
you can start writing your app without even knowing
what "SPA", "MPA", "SSR", and "static website" mean.
