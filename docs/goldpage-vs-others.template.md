**App types**

You can start with Goldpage's default app type.

Switching from one app type to another is easy.
You can start writing a prototype before even choosing an app type.


We believe you shouldn't have to know what "SPA", "MPA", "SSR", and "static website" mean before getting started.

**BFA**

Goldpage introduces a new app type
we call Backend First App (BFA).
It achieves blazing fast performance on mobile devices.

A BFA can be a simpler yet performant alternative to a native mobile app.

**Only One App Type**

The main problem of our current tools is that they support only one app type.
For example for React:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
create-react-app creates a so-called "SPA"
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Next.js creates a so-called "SSR app"
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Gatsby creates a so-called "static website"
<br/>

By choosing one of these tools you are essentially choosing an app type and locking yourself into that app type.
This means that before choosing one of these tools you have to research about what "SPA", "SSR", and "static website" mean and
what the differences between them are.
And that before even having started writing one line of code.

Even worse is that, most often than not,
it's not possible to predict which app type
is the right one
before having created and battle-tested a first prototype.

Goldpage solves this problem:
it supports all app types and makes switching from one app type to another easy &mdash;
you can start writing a prototype and worry about app type later.

We encourage you to start with Goldpage's default app type and,
once you finished your first prototype,
to experiment different app types with your prototye
and see what works best for you.

With Goldpage,
you can start writing your app without even knowing
what "SPA", "MPA", "SSR", and "static website" mean.

For readers that know what SSR is,
at
[Case study: Goldpage & SSR]()
we illustrate how, with Goldpage, you can
start without SSR,
add SSR to one of your pages,
see if SSR works out for that pages,
and add SSR to all your other pages.

And,
for readers that know what a static website is,
at
[Case study: Goldpage & Static Websites]()
we showcase how, with Goldpage, you can easily experiment and try out
if a static website is something that works out for you.

**Mobile Peformance**

Goldpage is the only tool (that we are aware of) allowing you
to remove the browser-side JavaScript.
Removing browser-side JavaScript
yealds a fast mobile performance.

**Flexibility**

We find other tools too "framework-ish".
Goldpage only takes care of building your pages and leaves the rest of the stack to you.
Where you may feel restricted with other tools
Goldpage gives you freedom.
For example,
Gatsby forces you to use GraphQL
whereas Goldpage leaves the choice of using GraphQL to you.

The backbone of Goldpage's flexibility is that it
allows you to fully control how and when your pages are rendered.
