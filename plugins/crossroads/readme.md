# `@ssr-coin/crossroads`

Routing with [Crossroads.js](https://github.com/millermedeiros/crossroads.js).

### Usage

The plugin is automatically loaded and
the `route` property of your page configs is now handled by Crossroads.

### Example

~~~js
// ./example/pages/hello.page.js

import React from 'react';

export default {
  route: '/hello/{name}',
  view: ({name}) => (
    <div>Hello {name}</div>
  ),
};
~~~
