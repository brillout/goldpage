Goldpage + Express = :heart:

# `@goldpage/express`

Use Goldpage with [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

### Usage

Install `@goldpage/express`.

~~~shell
$ npm install @goldpage/express
~~~

The plugin is automatically loaded and
an Express middleware is now available at `require('ssr-coin').express`.

### Example

~~~js
// ./example/server.js

const express = require('express');
const ssr = require('ssr-coin');

const app = express();

// ssr-coin also has middlewares for Koa, Hapi, etc.
app.use(ssr.express);

app.listen(3000, () => {console.log('Server is running')});
~~~
