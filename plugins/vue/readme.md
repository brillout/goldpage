`ssr-coin` + Vue = :heart:

# `@ssr-coin/vue`

Use `ssr-coin` with [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

### Usage

Install `@ssr-coin/vue`.

~~~shell
$ npm install @ssr-coin/vue
~~~

The plugin is automatically loaded and
the `view` property of your page configs will now be rendered with Vue.

### Example

~~~js
// ./example/pages/vue-welcome.page.js

import Vue from 'vue';

const app = new Vue({
    render: createElement => createElement('div', 'Hello from Vue'),
});

export default {
    route: '/',
    view: app,
};
~~~
